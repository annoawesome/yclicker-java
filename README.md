# yClicker Java
yClicker is a very simple GUI autoclicker for Wayland. It builds on the work of cli tools like `ydotool` by providing a user-friendly interface.

# Restrictions
* Can not stop with keybind when window is not focused
  * Workaround (KDE): Set window shortcut and enable "Suppress When Focus"

# Build
You will need the `ydotool` package and a way to build this project (best way is to use IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition) into a jar. Use java 21.
